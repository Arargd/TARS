# Totally Accurate Run Simulator (BepInEx Mod)  

### What It Does  
Adds the Wobbler from the Totally Accurate Games into Haste: Broken Worlds. 
Includes a few animations and SFX.
Replaces the default player "Zoe" entirely.

### How to Install  
1. Make sure **BepInEx** is installed.  
2. Unzip and drop the `Arargd-TARS` folder from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Arargd/TARS/releases/tag/Release) into `BepInEx/plugins/`.  
3. Start the game, once in the hub world you should be a Wobbler!

### Compatibility  
- Should be fine with other mods unless they replace Zoe / SFX as well.

### Notes
- The game will have its own mod system on release and installation is likely to change.
